### TV Script Generator
# Teach an AI to write an for your favorite TV show

#### Trains an RNN on a dataset of Seinfeld screenplays, then generates new, amusing scripts. Project for the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.

## Getting Started
### Step 1: Review my code and results in [dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb](https://github.com/technoempathy/tv_script_generator/blob/master/dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb "Title").

### Step 2: Do this project yourself
To make your own TV Script Generator, go [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-tv-script-generation "Title") and clone the repository.
```	
git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git
	cd deep-learning-v2-pytorch/project-tv-script-generation
```
Then open dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb 

## Prerequisites
1. Jupyter Notebooks
2. GPU
3. The [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv). 
4. PyTorch and Torchvision. For installation instructions see [Udacity's README in the Deep Learning repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch "Title").

## Tips
#### Leave extra time to tune hyperparameters
For information on how I chose mine, please read my inline comments, as well as the "Answer" markdown sections. 
I hope you have as much fun as I did!
