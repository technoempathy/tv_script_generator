### TV Script Generator
# Teach an AI to write an for your favorite TV show

#### Trains an RNN on a dataset of Seinfeld screenplays, then generates new, amusing scripts. Project for the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.

## Getting Started
### Step 1: Review my code and results in [dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb](https://github.com/technoempathy/tv_script_generator/blob/master/dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb "Title").

### Step 2: Do this project yourself
To make your own TV Script Generator, go [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-tv-script-generation "Title") and clone the repository, and open [dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-tv-script-generation "Title").
```	git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git
	cd deep-learning-v2-pytorch/project-tv-script-generation```
Then open dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb 

## Prerequisites
1. Jupyter Notebooks
2. GPU
3. The [Seinfeld dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset) from the UCI Machine Learning Database. 
4.	Pytorch and Torchvision. For installation instructions see [Udacity's README in the Deep Learning repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch "Title").

## Tips
#### Watch out for size mismatch. 
Almost all the challenges I ran into with this project happened as a result of size mismatch. Read the comments in my code to see where I had these problems and how I solved them.

## Known Issues
To pass all unit tests, I needed to add this print statement to the test_run function under unittests.
`print(network.run(inputs))`

The print statment should be added here:
```
def test_run(self):
        # Test correctness of run method
        network = NeuralNetwork(3, 2, 1, 0.5)
        network.weights_input_to_hidden = test_w_i_h.copy()
        network.weights_hidden_to_output = test_w_h_o.copy()
        print(network.run(inputs)) #Add the print statement here
        self.assertTrue(np.allclose(network.run(inputs), 0.09998924))
 ```
